So I installed boost onto my windows box.  I did the default configuration

bootstrap.bat
.\b2 --build-dir="c:\Program Files\boost\tmp"

On completion it said this


The Boost C++ Libraries were successfully built!

The following directory should be added to compiler include paths:

    C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_65_1

The following directory should be added to linker library paths:

    C:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_65_1\stage\lib



I finally got a sample log program to build using
cl /EHsc /Zi /MD /I "c:\Program Files\boost\boost_1_65_1" logtest.cpp /link /LIBPATH:"C:\program files\boost\boost_1_65_1\stage\lib" libboost_log-vc141-mt-1_65_1.lib

/Z1 is debug
/MD is dynamic linking to standard libraries


On windows, I had now luck with the automatic linking, so I didn't #define BOOST_LOG_DYN_LINK or BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK

Sometimes, it seems to complaing about defining _WIN32_WINDOWS and such.  You can fix that by addint <sdkddkver.h>
